### 1\. `C-Vector`: A Dynamic Array Library

# Project Title: `C-Vector` - A Generic Dynamic Array Library

## Overview

C++ has `std::vector`, a powerful tool for managing dynamic arrays. C arrays, however, are fixed in size. This project is about creating `C-Vector`, a library that provides a generic, type-safe dynamic array (vector) implementation in C. The library will manage its own memory, growing as needed when new elements are added.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a vector.
  - Get the current size and capacity of the vector.
  - Add an element to the end (`push_back`).
  - Remove an element from the end (`pop_back`).
  - Get or set the element at a specific index.
  - Automatically resize (grow) the internal array when its capacity is reached.

## Demo Application Idea

A command-line program that reads an unknown number of integers from the user, stores them in a `C-Vector`, and then prints them out along with the final size and capacity of the vector.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Dynamic Memory Management**: `malloc`, `realloc`, `free`.
  - **Amortized Analysis**: Understanding the performance of resizing.
  - **Generic Programming in C**: Using `void*` and `memcpy` to handle any data type.
  - **API Design**: Creating a clean and reusable interface.

Of course\! Here are two additional project ideas focusing on the stack and queue data structures, following the same format.

### 2\. `C-HashMap`: A Hash Map Library

# Project Title: `C-HashMap` - A Key-Value Hash Map Library

## Overview

Many modern languages have built-in dictionaries or hash maps. This project involves building a hash map in C to store key-value pairs. Your library should handle string keys and `void*` values, allowing it to store any type of data. It must efficiently handle hash collisions.

## Core Features

  - Create and destroy a hash map.
  - Insert a key-value pair.
  - Retrieve a value given a key.
  - Delete a key-value pair.
  - Check if a key exists.
  - Implement a string hashing function (e.g., djb2).
  - Handle collisions using **chaining** (linked lists at each bucket).

## Demo Application Idea

A word frequency counter. The demo program should read a text file, use the `C-HashMap` library to store each unique word as a key and its frequency count as the value, and then print the results.

## Key Learning Concepts

  - **Hashing**: Designing hash functions and handling collisions.
  - **Data Structures**: Combining arrays and linked lists.
  - **Pointer Management**: Managing memory for keys, values, and nodes.
  - **API Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details from the user.

### 3. `C-BST`: A Binary Search Tree Library

# Project Title: `C-BST` - A Binary Search Tree Library

## Overview

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure where each node has up to two children: the left subtree contains values less than the node’s key, and the right subtree contains values greater than it.
This project implements a **simple, unbalanced BST** in C — ideal for learning how trees are built, traversed, and modified without the extra complexity of balancing algorithms.

## Core Features

* Create and destroy a BST.
* Insert, search, and delete keys.
* Optional support for storing **key-value pairs** (like a map).
* Traversal functions:

  * **Inorder** (sorted order)
  * **Preorder**
  * **Postorder**
* Optional recursive or iterative implementations.

## Demo Application Idea

A **contact manager**: each contact’s name is the key (string), and their phone number or email is the value.
The user can add, remove, or search contacts, and print the contact list alphabetically using an inorder traversal.

## Key Learning Concepts

* **Tree Fundamentals**: Understanding parent-child relationships and recursive structure.
* **Recursion Practice**: Implementing traversal and search logic recursively.
* **Dynamic Memory**: Managing node creation and deletion with `malloc`/`free`.
* **Ordered Data**: Using trees to maintain sorted data efficiently.
